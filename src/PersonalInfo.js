            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jerry Liu, a third-year student at the University of Chicago, studying Computer Science, Math, and Statistics. I'm really into software development, data science, AI, and research. When I'm not studying, I love rock climbing, hiking, playing poker, eating sushi, and watching movies. I'm always up for a challenge and trying new things, but I also enjoy my comfort zone when being alone (except hitting the gym). I dabble a bit in fashion and love shopping for new tech.</p>
