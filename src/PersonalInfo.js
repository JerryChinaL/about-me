            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jerry. My best skills are mathematical thinking, programming, and machine learning. I also embraced opportunities related to trading and investing. During undergrad, I've acquired a broad skill set that would keep me adaptable and prepared for more opportunity in the future. </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, hiking, playing poker, and photography. I've been to 8 national parks in the US and I hope to explore more of them. My short plan is to take a good photo and hang it big on my wall. Further down the road, I want to drive on race tracks and get a pilot license.  </p>
