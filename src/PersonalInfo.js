            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jerry. My best skills are mathematical thinking, programming, and machine learning. I have also developed an interest in the financial market and hope to learn more about trading and investing. Throughout my education, I wanted to make sure I had a broad skill set that would keep me adaptable and prepared for any opportunity down the road.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, hiking, playing poker, and photography. I've been to 8 national parks in the US and I hope to explore more of them. My short plan is to take a good photo and hang it big on my wall. Further down the road, I want to drive on race tracks and get a pilot license.  </p>
